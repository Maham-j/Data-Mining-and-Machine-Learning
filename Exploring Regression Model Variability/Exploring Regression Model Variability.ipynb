    "\n",
    "- **Random seeds**: Changing the random seed alters the specific data points in the train-test split. This can lead to variability in model performance, especially if the dataset isn't large enough to ensure consistent splits. It's essential to set a random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset size**: Training on smaller fractions of the data (e.g., 25%) can lead to higher MSE due to insufficient learning. As the training data size increases, the model's performance typically improves, evidenced by a lower MSE.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of a linear regression model is influenced by the train-test split ratio, the random seed used for data splitting, and the size of the training dataset. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial for building robust predictive models. "
